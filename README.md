## Chapters

[02. Write Hello World with raw React APIs](https://github.com/xgirma/intro-to-the-beginner-guid-to-ractjs/tree/ch.02/chapters/ch.02)

In this lesson we'll learn how to use raw React APIs to create the most basic Hello World example. React defines itâ€™s own `createElement` function that we will see works similar to `document.createElement`. And in place of `appendChild` we will use `ReactDOM's render` function.

We'll also learn a little bit about React props and the children prop.

[03. Use JSX with React](https://github.com/xgirma/intro-to-the-beginner-guid-to-ractjs/tree/ch.03/chapters/ch.03)

In this lesson we'll learn the basics of using JSX with React. In addition to the noted className difference, there are a number of other [differences with attributes in JSX than those in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html).


[04. Create Custom React Components](https://github.com/xgirma/intro-to-the-beginner-guid-to-ractjs/tree/ch.04/chapters/ch.04)

Just like in regular JavaScript, when you want to `reuse code`, you create a `function`. With React, you `create components`. In this lesson we'll walk through the process of creating custom React components and you'll walk away with a deep understanding of how to create and use basic components to `compose` a larger component you render.

[05. Validate Custom React Component Props with PropTypes](https://github.com/xgirma/intro-to-the-beginner-guid-to-ractjs/tree/ch.05/chapters/ch.05)

In this lesson we'll learn about how you can use the `prop-types` module to validate a custom React component's `props`.
