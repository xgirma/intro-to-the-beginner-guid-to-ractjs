## Chapters

[02. Write Hello World with raw React APIs]()

In this lesson we'll learn how to use raw React APIs to create the most basic Hello World example. React defines itâ€™s own `createElement` function that we will see works similar to `document.createElement`. And in place of `appendChild` we will use `ReactDOM's render` function.

We'll also learn a little bit about React props and the children prop.
