# Build and deploy a React Application

In this lesson we'll see how simple it is to **prototype** a React application right in your browser using **CodeSandbox.io**, then to **download** that application locally and use the **react-scripts** which are setup automatically to develop and build the application for production. We'll wrap up by deploying the application to **Netlify** (using a free account) for the world to see.
